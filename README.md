**A minimal and fast shell prompt written in Rust.**

- **Fast:** ðŸš€
- **Universal:** Works on any shell, on any operating system
- **Easy-to-hack:** Very easy to add a feature or change a behaviour due to the minimal codebase

## Installation

### Building from source

1. Install and setup [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)
2. Run `cargo install mshp`

### Pre-compiled binary

1. Download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/yuqio/mshp/releases)
2. Move the binary to your `PATH`

## Usage

### Bash, Dash, Ksh, etc.

On most POSIX compatible shells you can add the following line to your init file (e.g. `.bashrc`):

```sh
PS1="$(mshp)"
```

### Zsh

Add the following to your `.zshrc` file:

```zsh
precmd() {
    PS1="$(mshp)"
}
```

### Ion

Add the following to your `.config/ion/initrc` file:

```ion
fn PROMPT
    echo -n "$(mshp)"
end
```

## Configuration

`mshp` can be configured via environment variables.

### Color strings

Variables ending with `_COLOR` take a string as value that can be one of the following:

- `default` or empty (sets the color to the default foreground color defined by the terminal)
- A written out ANSII color (`black`, `red`, `green`, `yellow`, `blue`, `magenta`, `cyan`, `white`)
- A ANSII number (e.g. `1` for red)
- A hex color beginning with `#` (e.g. `#00F` or `#0000FF` for blue)

### Available settings

The following environment variables are available:
